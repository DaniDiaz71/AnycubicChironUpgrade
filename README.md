# AnycubicChironUpgrade

Documentation and other stuff about how upgrade Anycubic Chiron 3D printer from 8 bits to 32 bits electronics, including upgrade stepper drivers to TMC2208. Then i'll configure Marlin.

Work still in progress...

Step 01 - Done!

Step 02 - Done!

Step 03 - Done! 

Step in progress - Serial communications between TFT and Trigorilla reverse engineering, to know which commands display sends to Trigorilla and which Trigorilla sends to display. With this information I think i'm going to be able to adapt Marlin firmware to use it with SKR v1.3 and TFT Anycubic display.
